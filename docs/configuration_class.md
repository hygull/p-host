```
To include the app in our project, we need to add a reference to its configuration class in the

INSTALLED_APPS setting. The PollsConfig class is in the polls/apps.py file, so its dotted path is

'polls.apps.PollsConfig'. Edit the mysite/settings.py file and add that dotted path to the 

INSTALLED_APPS setting. Itâ€™ll look like this:

mysite/settings.py

```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'polls.apps.PollsConfig',
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
]

```
